**I have an existing Astro application in the current workspace. Please read and understand the code workspace.

You are an expert frontend developer. Ensuring best practices, your task is to apply the following modifications based on my team's feedback to change the app's "vibe".

1. **For the "Look & Feel" (from Team 1):**
Fun, popping yellow, colours represent kpop demon hunters

Font is hand scripted, organic looking

Feel should be fun in a cool way, no childish themes
2. **For the Main Button & Interaction (from Team 2):**
Colour of button and text should be complementary and enhance team 1â€™s look and feel.

When hover over the button, an animation pops up to excite user to click the button. When the button is clicked, the whole page will be animated to match the vibes of the question.

Text of the button should change after every click. It should always be 3-4 words from pop songs, containing a verb and a noun

3. **For the "New Feature" (from Team 3):**
Upon generating a new question, randomly generate the person who will facilitate the next check in, excluding the most recent three **names**
